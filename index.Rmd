## About Me

* I am currently living in New York City working for the New York City Department of Health.

* Before moving to New York City, I spent two and a half years working in Baltimore doing medical simulation for Maryland and DC area hospitals.

* I was born in Philadelphia but have spent most of my life living in Maryland.

## My Education and Work History

* You can learn about me and find my resume [here](about.html)

## Example Work

* For a demonstration of my knowledge in R I have provided some interactive plots and graphs on a [flexdashboard.](flexdashboard.html) These plots were created using the NYC Department of Health's Restaurant Inspection Dataset.

* An example project of mine can be found [here.](https://ilz2105.github.io/disasters.github.io/) This was my final group project completed for my Data Science course at Columbia exploring associations between rising temperatures and natural disasters in the United States. It should be noted this project does make some references and jokes specific to the class.
